SNPDoc
======

Single Nucleotide Polymorphism annotation utility

SNPDoc is a relatively lightweight annotation tool for lists of SNPs as generated from genome-wide association studies (GWAS).  It has three major modes: annotate named snps, annotate a position or retrieve a list of snps from a chromosomal region.  It will optionally save results to a local SQLite database to avoid subsequent web searches.  SNPDoc merges any user data associated with the snp list (statistiscal data from the GWAS for example).
